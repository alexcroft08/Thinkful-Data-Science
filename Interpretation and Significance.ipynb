Interpret the estimated coefficients. What additional statistics should be given in order to make sure that your interpretations make sense statistically. Write up your answer."

    "Statistically, since the coefficients of annualincome and annualincome squared are so low, I would argue they almost have zero effect on the target variable expenditure, and should be removed from the model. The having kids coefficient of -223.57 seems to be driving all the change in expenditure in this model. Additional tests to find out p values of the coefficients could further verify their statistical significance."
