1. What was the hottest day in our data set? Where was that?
2. How many trips started at each station?
3. What's the shortest trip that happened?
4. What is the average trip duration, by end station?

1. Answer is 134 at zip 94063
SELECT
	zip,
	MAX(maxtemperaturef) as maxtemp
	
FROM
	weather

GROUP BY
	1
  
  2. 
  SELECT
	start_station,
	COUNT(trip_id) as tripcount

FROM 
	trips
	
GROUP BY start_station;

3. The shortest trip is 60
SELECT
	trip_id,
	MIN(duration) as triptime

FROM 
	trips
	
GROUP BY 
	trip_id

ORDER BY 
	triptime
  
4.
SELECT
	end_station,
	AVG(duration) as tripavg

FROM 
	trips
	
GROUP BY 
	end_station

ORDER BY
	tripavg DESC;
